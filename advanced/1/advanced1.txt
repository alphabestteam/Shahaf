OOP â€“ Special Functions

1. Magic functions are methods that two prefix underscores and two suffix underscores in the name. They are commonly used for operator overloading. Some examples for magic functions:
__init__ - for initialization of a class instance. The constructor.
__str__ - to determine what happens to the object when we print it.
__eq__ - defines behavior for equal operator.
__del__ - the destructor.

2. If we won't create the __str__ magic function, the location in the memory will be printed.

3. If we won't create the __eq__ magic function, it will return True just if they are the same object, not if they are equal.

4. Operator overloading means giving another meaning beyond their pre predicted meaning. Giving it meaning for each private instance.
