OOP â€“ Special Functions

1. Magic functions are methods that two prefix underscores and two suffix underscores in the name. They are commonly used for operator overloading. Some examples for magic functions:
__init__ - for initialization of a class instance. The constructor.
__str__ - to determine what happens to the object when we print it.
__eq__ - defines behavior for equal operator.
__del__ - the destructor.

2. If we won't create the __str__ magic function, the location in the memory will be printed.

3. If we won't create the __eq__ magic function, it will return True just if they are the same object, not if they are equal.

4. Operator overloading means giving another meaning beyond their pre predicted meaning. Giving it meaning for each private instance.

5.d. equal - it will print False even though they are equal but because they are not the same object it will print False.

Print - it will the location in the memory of the objects.

Add - won't be able to add them because it doesn't know how to add point type objects.

To fix those problems we can create magic functions for the Point class.
