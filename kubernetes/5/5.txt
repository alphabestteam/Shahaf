1. kubectl scale deployment backend-deployment --replicas=3 -n my-namespace
kubectl get pods -n my-namespace #to check number of replicas

2. kubectl scale deployment frontend-deployment --replicas=3 -n my-namespace

3. the scaling allows us to increase or decrease (according to demand) the number of pods running of our app to handle higher or lower demand of the app.
if we have high demand we will increase the number of running pods.
if we have low demand we will decrease the number of running pods.
