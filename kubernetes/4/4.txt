the problem with the way we used the env vars is that when we want to change the values we will need to config the yaml file and reapply it.
also it is very not secure to write the env vars and their values in the config file.

to solve this problem we will use configmap.yaml of kind ConfigMap. in this file we will config the env vars as key, value pairs.
to use the env vars we will write in the other yaml the key to the value.
we can also use secret.yaml with type Opaque which is used for sensitive info that needs to be secured.

to make the backend-url secured we will use the secret.yaml.
