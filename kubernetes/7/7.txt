1. Readiness Probes is a functionality that ensures the health of the container (if it can accept traffic).
this is super important because it ensures that the container in the pod can handle requests before it gets traffic.
it improves the reliability of the app.

2. the risks of not using Readiness Probes are:
- requests may be sent to unhealthy containers and then users may experience errors and bad performance.
- it may increase downtime because traffic might be sent to unready containers.
- when scaling traffic might be sent to not fully functioning containers.
- we will have limited control over the lifecycle of the app in the container. we wont be able to determine if the app is filly ready.
- Readiness Probes can help with diagnosing issues and it can be harder to find the root cause without it.
