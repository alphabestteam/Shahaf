1. in kubernetes the object that exposes your application to the external world is typically a Service of type Ingress.
it exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes outside the cluster to services inside the cluster.
we will use ingress instead of nodeport because ingress is secured better with ssl and nodeport use only http/HTTPS.

2. i created nodeport-service.yaml

kubectl apply -f nodeport-service.yaml

kubectl get svc -n my-namespace #to check if the service works

minikube service my-nodeport-service -n my-namespace --url

(the url i got http://127.0.0.1:52273)
