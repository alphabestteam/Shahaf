1. the layering mechanism helps make the development faster by caching each layer in the building process, reusing layer components,
once an image is built it is consistent and layers can br built in parallel.  

2. method 1 is better to run command one after the other because method 2 makes the execution in parallel in contrast to method 1 that 
execute the commands one by one.

3. the command docker history <IMAGE_NAME> can show us the history of image including the layers and the commands used to create each layer.
