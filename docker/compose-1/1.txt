1. version - the version of the docker compose
services - define the containers to run
mongo \ mongo-express - the name of the container
image - the image the container is using to run the container
container-name - assigns a name for the container
environment - sets environment variables
ports - sets ports for the container
volumes - sets volumes for the container

docker compose down
