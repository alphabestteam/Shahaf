1. docker is a platform for managing applications, we can develop , ship and run applications.
docker help us reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.
docker provides the ability to package and run an application in an isolated environment (container).
this lets you run many containers on one host and the application will run successfully on any computer that has docker.

2. docker image is the package with all the necessary parts that the application will need to run.
with the image we create a container. it is created by building a dockerfile.

3. docker container is the instance of the image. the container runs the application in an isolated space with all the parts it needs to run successfully.
the container is portable and can run the same across different devices.

4. the difference between a docker image and a docker container is that the image is the package of parts of the application and the container actually runs the app.
images are writable, static and used for distribution, container is dynamic and execute the app.
we can create many containers from one image.

5. environment variable is is a value that can affect the way running processes behave on a computer.
 the variable is part of the isolated environment that the app is executed on.

6. a volume is a way to change and share between the container and the host system and it also can share data between containers.
the volume helps store and manage data that needs to stay after the lifecycle of one container.
