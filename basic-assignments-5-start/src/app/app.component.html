      <strong>The Forceful Interface:</strong> In the provided `film-data.ts` file, export a list of objects representing Star Wars movies. Each object should have fields like `title`, `episode`, `director`, and `releaseDate`. Create an Angular TypeScript interface named `StarWarsMovie` that defines the structure of these movie objects. Use the Force wisely â€“ make sure to account for all relevant fields.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Routing through Hyperspace:</strong> Set up Angular routing by creating a route named `star-wars-movies`. Ensure that this route corresponds to a component that will display information about all Star Wars movies. May the route be with you!
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Master of NgFor:</strong> Leverage the power of `ngFor` to iterate through the list of Star Wars movies in your `star-wars-movies` component. Display each movie using a reusable component named `MovieCardComponent`. This component should take a `StarWarsMovie` as an input and elegantly present the movie's details.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>The Galactic Display:</strong> Implement the `MovieCardComponent` to showcase the movie details such as title, episode, director, and release date. Let the Force guide you as you unleash the power of Angular components!
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>The Static Example:</strong> Uncomment the provided static example in the `star-wars-movies` component to display a sample movie. This example can serve as a guide for implementing the dynamic display using the `ngFor` directive.
